Composite design pattern helps to compose the objects into tree structures to represent whole-part hierarchies. 
Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

Composite design pattern is a structural pattern which modifies the structure of an object. 
This pattern is most suitable in cases where you need to work with objects which form a tree like hierarchy. 
In that tree, each node/object (except root node) is either composite or leaf node. 
Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
