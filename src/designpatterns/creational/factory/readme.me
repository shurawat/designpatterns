Factory design pattern is most suitable when complex object creation steps are involved. 
To ensure that these steps are centralized and not exposed to composing classes.

By now, you should be able to count the main advantages of using the factory pattern. Let’s note down:

1. The creation of an object precludes its reuse without significant duplication of code.
2. The creation of an object requires access to information or resources that should not be contained within the composing class.
3. The lifetime management of the generated objects must be centralized to ensure a consistent behavior within the application.
