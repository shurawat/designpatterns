  builder pattern will help you to consume additional attributes while retaining the immutability of Use class.
  
  Builder design pattern is an alternative way to construct complex objects 
  and should be used only when we want to build different types of immutable objects using same object building process.


  Builder pattern aims to “Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation 
  so that the same construction process can create different representations.”
