Prototype design pattern is used in scenarios where application needs to create a large number of instances of a class,
which have almost same state or differ very little.

In this design pattern, an instance of actual object (i.e. prototype) is created on starting, 
and thereafter whenever a new instance is required, this prototype is cloned to have another instance. 

The main advantage of this pattern is to have minimal instance creation
process which is much costly than cloning process.
