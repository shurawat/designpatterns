Flyweight design pattern enables use sharing of objects to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently. 
A flyweight is a shared object that can be used in multiple contexts simultaneously. 
The flyweight acts as an independent object in each context.


We can use flyweight pattern in following scenarios:

- When we need a large number of similar objects that are unique in terms of only a few parameters and most of the stuffs are common in general.
- We need to control the memory consumption by large number of objects – by creating fewer objects and sharing them across.
