Bridge design pattern is used to decouple a class into two parts – abstraction and it’s implementation
 – so that both can evolve in future without affecting each other. 
It increases the loose coupling between class abstraction and it’s implementation.

Bridge design pattern is most applicable in applications where you need to provide platform independence.
